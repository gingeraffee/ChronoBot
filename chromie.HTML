  <h1>ChronoBot – Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="meta">
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Nov 30, 2025]</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    ChronoBot (“<strong>Chromie</strong>”, “<strong>the bot</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) is a Discord bot
    that provides countdowns and reminder messages for events in Discord servers.
    By adding ChronoBot to your server or interacting with the bot in any way,
    you (“<strong>you</strong>”, “<strong>users</strong>”, “<strong>server owners</strong>”) agree to these Terms of Service.
  </p>

  <p>
    ChronoBot is an independent project and is <strong>not</strong> affiliated with, endorsed by,
    or officially connected to Discord Inc.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility & Acceptable Use</h2>

  <p>
    To use ChronoBot, you must comply with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Guidelines</a>, and</li>
    <li>All applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may not use ChronoBot to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Harass, abuse, or spam other users.</li>
    <li>Plan, promote, or coordinate illegal activities.</li>
    <li>Collect or store sensitive personal information in event names or descriptions.</li>
    <li>Attempt to disrupt, reverse-engineer, or abuse the bot or Discord’s API.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Service Description</h2>

  <p>ChronoBot provides, among other features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Event countdowns and a pinned countdown message in a configured channel.</li>
    <li>Reminder messages at selected milestones before your event (for example 100 days, 50 days, about 1 month, 14 days, 7 days, 2 days, the day before, and the day of the event).</li>
    <li>Slash commands used to configure and manage events (such as setting an event channel, adding events, listing events, and removing events).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Features may change, be added, or be removed at any time. We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently
    suspend the bot, a specific feature, or access for individual servers or users.
  </p>

  <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>

  <p>
    ChronoBot is provided on an “<strong>as is</strong>” and “<strong>as available</strong>” basis.
    We do not guarantee that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Countdowns or reminders will always be accurate, timely, or delivered.</li>
    <li>The bot will be online 24/7 or free from errors, bugs, or interruptions.</li>
    <li>All data stored by the bot will be retained or available indefinitely.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You use ChronoBot at your own risk. You should not rely on ChronoBot as your only reminder system
    for critical, legal, medical, or financial deadlines.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>

  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
    consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, events, opportunities, or profits,
    arising from your use of or inability to use ChronoBot.
  </p>

  <p>
    If, despite the above, we are found liable for any claim related to ChronoBot, our total liability
    will be limited to the amount (if any) you have paid directly to us for the use of ChronoBot in the
    preceding three (3) months, or one U.S. dollar (USD $1.00), whichever is greater.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Termination</h2>

  <p>
    You may stop using ChronoBot at any time by removing the bot from your server.
    We may remove the bot from your server, restrict features, or block access at our discretion,
    including if we believe these Terms or Discord’s policies have been violated.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>

  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect changes to the bot or to legal requirements.
    When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
    Continued use of ChronoBot after changes are posted means you accept the revised Terms.

  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains what information ChronoBot (“Chromie”) collects and how it is used.
    By using ChronoBot, you agree to this Policy.

    <li>Event data, such as event names and dates/times.</li>
    <li>User IDs for users who link their account to a server for DM-based commands.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    ChronoBot does <strong>not</strong> intentionally store general message content outside of commands
    or data needed to operate countdown and reminder features.
  </p>

  <h3>b) Logs and Operational Data</h3>

  <p>
    The hosting platform may generate logs that include technical information such as timestamps, error messages,
    and possibly user IDs or guild IDs when errors occur. These logs are used for debugging and maintenance.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

  <p>We use collected information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate countdown and reminder features.</li>
    <li>Maintain pinned countdown messages in your configured channel.</li>
    <li>Send milestone reminders to your server at the appropriate times.</li>
    <li>Allow some configuration to be done via DM for linked users.</li>
    <li>Monitor and improve stability, performance, and security of the bot.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    We do not sell your data. We may share limited information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>With our hosting or infrastructure providers, to run the bot.</li>
    <li>If required to comply with applicable laws, legal requests, or to protect our rights or the rights of others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

  <p>
    Event and configuration data are retained as long as reasonably needed to operate ChronoBot for your server.
    If you remove ChronoBot from your server, we may delete related data as part of routine cleanup.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    ChronoBot is intended for use in Discord, which is restricted to users aged 13 or older (or the minimum age
    required in their country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Remove ChronoBot from your server at any time.</li>

    <li>Contact us if you have questions or requests related to your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top.
    Continued use of ChronoBot after changes are posted means you accept the revised Policy.
